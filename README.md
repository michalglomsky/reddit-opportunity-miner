# ‚õèÔ∏è Reddit Opportunity Miner

## üöÄ Overview

Reddit Opportunity Miner is a Python-based command-line tool designed to analyze Reddit subreddits to identify potential business opportunities, user pain points, and ideas suitable for automation or AI-powered solutions.

It uses a hybrid data fetching strategy, leveraging the official Reddit API (via PRAW) for recent data and the Pushshift API for historical data. The core of the tool is an analysis pipeline orchestrated by LangGraph, which uses a Large Language Model (via Groq) to perform deep analysis and classification on relevant Reddit posts.

All findings are stored in a local SQLite database, allowing for persistent storage and sophisticated, time-based analysis of opportunities across multiple runs.

## ‚ú® Features

- üåê **Hybrid Data Fetching:** Uses PRAW for recent posts and Pushshift for historical archives.
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis:** Leverages a Groq-powered LLM (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) to analyze post content and comments.
- üìù **Structured Insights:** Extracts pain points, business opportunities, and automation ideas.
- üè∑Ô∏è **Dual-Layer Classification:** Categorizes each opportunity into a main category and a specific sub-category.
- üóÑÔ∏è **Persistent Storage:** Saves all findings in a local SQLite database (`reddit_miner.db`).
- üèÉ **Run & Batch Tracking:** Every execution is logged as a "run," and opportunities are linked to the run in which they were found.
- üîÑ **Continuous Operation:** Can run continuously until a target number of new opportunities are found.
- üìà **Powerful Reporting:** Provides a flexible reporting engine to generate percentage-based summaries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    - Python 3.8+

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure API Keys:**
    - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
    - Open the `.env` file and add your API credentials for Groq and Reddit.

4.  **Initialize the Database:**
    Before running for the first time, you must initialize the database. This command creates the `reddit_miner.db` file and all necessary tables.
    ```bash
    python main.py db init
    ```
    **Note:** You must run this command again if the database schema is ever updated. This is a destructive operation that will reset all stored data.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

The tool is operated via the command line using three main commands: `run`, `report`, and `db`.

### üîç `run`: Finding New Opportunities

This command starts a new analysis run to find and save opportunities.

**Usage:**
```bash
python main.py run <subreddit> -k <keyword1> <keyword2> ... [--target <number>]
```

**Arguments:**
- **`subreddit`**: The name of the subreddit to scan (e.g., `SaaS`).
- **`-k, --keywords`**: (Required) One or more keywords to look for in post titles and bodies.
- **`--target`**: (Optional) The number of **new** opportunities to find before stopping. The tool will run in batches until this target is met. Defaults to `10`.
- **`-t, --time`**: (Optional) Use `recent` (default) for continuous scanning or a year (e.g., `2022`) for a one-time historical search.

### üíæ `db`: Managing the Database

This command is used for database maintenance.

**Usage:**
```bash
python main.py db <db_command>
```

**Commands:**
- **`init`**: Re-initializes the database. **Warning: This deletes all existing data.**
- **`list_runs`**: Shows a history of all previous runs. Can be filtered with `--runs-after` and `--runs-before`.

### üìã `report`: Analyzing Stored Results

This is the primary tool for analyzing the data you have collected. It generates a summary report with counts and percentages.

**Usage:**
```bash
python main.py report <report_type> [filters...]
```

**Report Types:**
- **`category`**: A summary of all main categories.
- **`subcategory`**: A summary of sub-categories. Requires the `--category` filter to be specified.
- **`subreddit_bias`**: A summary of categories broken down by the subreddit they were found in.

**Filters (can be combined):**
- `--run-ids <ID1> <ID2>`: Filters for specific run IDs.
- `--runs-after <YYYY-MM-DD>`: Filters for runs executed after a date.
- `--runs-before <YYYY-MM-DD>`: Filters for runs executed before a date.
- `--posts-after <YYYY-MM-DD>`: Filters for opportunities from posts created after a date.
- `--posts-before <YYYY-MM-DD>`: Filters for opportunities from posts created before a date.
- `--category <CategoryName>`: (Required for `subcategory` report) Specifies the parent category to analyze.

## üìä Understanding the Analysis Output

Each opportunity saved in the database contains the following fields generated by the AI analysis:

- **`pain_points`**: A list of direct problems, frustrations, or unmet needs mentioned by users in the Reddit post and comments. This is the raw "voice of the customer."
- **`business_opportunities`**: A list of potential products, services, or business ideas that could directly solve the identified pain points.
- **`automation_ideas`**: A list of specific, actionable ideas for how software, automation, or a dedicated AI tool could address the needs. This is often more technical than the `business_opportunities`.
- **`confidence_score`**: A score from 1-10 representing the AI's assessment of how strong and clear the business opportunity is, based on the source discussion.
- **`summary`**: A concise, one-paragraph summary of the entire opportunity.
- **`category`**: The primary business vertical the opportunity falls into.
- **`sub_category`**: A more specific niche within the main category.
